/*Seperate compliation
code split into multiple source files not just one
Reasons: takes time to compile large files
developers work on teams, distribute work by distributing files

souce files have code dependincies - one file define classes and functioons that another file needs
Provide structure to know it it's used correctly
doesn't need to know what the class does, just how it looks
communication between files happens in header files

header files contain 
def of class
def of constants
declerations of non member functions

source files 
implementation of member functions and non member functions

seperating class defininition from the class implementation

header file, .h extension
source file, .cpp extension
class def in .h file
class implementation in .cpp file
